Raahi app features:
- Travelgram (social feed): users share posts with images, captions, location, tags; you can like and comment.
- Scrapbook: users upload photos, choose a theme, create pages (2–3 photo layouts), add captions, preview with Swiper animations, download PNG, and save to profile for later viewing.
- User Profile: shows posts and saved scrapbooks; avatar can be updated (uploads saved under /uploads).
- Trip Tracker: create/join trips, share live location on a Leaflet map with polling; SOS triggers an event on backend.
- Travel Packages & Explore India: curated content about destinations and packages.
Helpful hints:
- To save a scrapbook: create it, then click "Save to Profile"; later open it from the profile "Scrapbooks" section.
- If images don't show, ensure URLs are prefixed with the backend origin (http://localhost:3000).
